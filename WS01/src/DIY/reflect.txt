    Theworkshop was very difficult to follow and I was unable to login to the matrix due to a problem with the seneca student VPN. I need more time espescially since
    I don't understand programming c++ The 1st part in it self is not difficult but part 2 was difficult as 
    the compiler wouldn't compile due to an error in finding directory. I used string functions like strCpy, strnCpy in order to copy strings and use it to invoke into functions for checking
    which are i am using by string library before this workshop.
    I made several functions for strings and learn how they works by this workshop. In my first semester C course (btp100) i was using string library for strings.
    From this workshop I made that function on my own and I didn't use any string library provided by C++. 

    For 1st part of workshop I separated the main file containing all the code and the functions into
    modules and linked them together to make application readable and easily accessible. 
    I used header module into the main cpp module and safeguarded header modules. 
    safeguards protect from multiple inclusions. I also played with th e code to see how different segments of code use the functions i enlisted in the header file 

    In second part of workshop I learned about structure of string function and implementation of them. Second part was very interesting and I had some little issue in
    strStr function. I was getting warning during run time as nullptr is not defined, then i include iostream header file and it worked. Everything else is easy to 
    implement and i had not face any issues as i am familiar with string functions from btp100 course.
